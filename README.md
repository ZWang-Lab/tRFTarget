# tRFtarget
**tRFtarget** (http://trftarget.net/) is a relational database to explore binding targets of Transfer RNA derived Fragments (tRFs).

## About tRF
**Transfer RNA derived fragments** (**tRFs**) are a new class of small non-coding RNA (ncRNA) in the length of 13-48 nucleotides. tRFs are derived from non-random cleavage of either the precursor or mature tRNA.

## About tRFtarget
**tRFtarget** is a relational database respect to the computational predicted binding interactions between between tRFs and target transcripts for multiple organisms based on the state-of-the-art prediction tools [*RNAhybrid*](https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid) and [*IntaRNA*](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp).

The database can provide detailed information about the binding interactions as well as an illustration of the interaction sequences. Furthermore, the database can be also searched by *tRF ID*, *gene* or *transcript* to get a comprehensive overview of tRF-transcript interactions.

The database also integrates manually curated experimental evidences for tRF-target interactions from publications. The experimental evidences are classed into 2 categories: *gene level evidences* and *site level evidences*, and will be updated periodically.

Our database is expected to facilitate the research of tRFs on the below aspects:
* guide the validation experiments for targets of tRFs.
* provide a clue of the biological functionality of tRF by downstream gene enrichment analysis of the target genes.
* help to construct the Motif of tRFs based on predicted binding interactions.
