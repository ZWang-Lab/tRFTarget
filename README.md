# tRFTarget
**tRF Target** (http://trftarget.net/) is a relational database to explore binding targets of Transfer RNA related or derived Fragments (tRFs).

## About tRF
**Transfer RNA-related or derived Fragments** (**tRFs**) are first identified as a new class of small non-coding RNA in 2009. tRFs are in the length of nucleotides and are derived from non-random cleavage of the precursor or mature transfer RNA.

## About tRF Target
**tRF Target** is a relational database respect to the computational predicted binding interactions between human tRFs and target transcripts based on the state-of-the-art prediction tools [*RNAhybrid*](https://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/rnahybrid) and [*IntaRNA*](http://rna.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/IntaRNA/Input.jsp).

The database can provide detailed information about the binding interactions as well as an illustration of the interaction sequences. Furthermore, the database can be also searched by *tRF ID*, *gene* or *transcript* to get a comprehensive overview of tRF-transcript interactions.

Our database is expected to facilitate the research of tRFs on the below aspects:
* guide the validation experiments of one specific tRF and one transcript.
* provide a clue of the biological functionality of tRF from the perspective of comprehensive tRF-transcript interactions. 
* help to construct the Motif of tRFs based on predicted binding interactions.
